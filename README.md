## Introduction and Objectives Analysis
This data analysis aims to determine the extent of the availability of adequate accommodation information in NTB, especially on Lombok Island as the main island, considering the majority of travelers use Traveloka as a means to find accommodation at tourist destinations (Populix, 2022). In addition, we will also explore the availability of accommodation and how satisfied tourists are with the accommodation on Lombok Island. The benefits of this analysis are certainly to provide a guideline for relevant stakeholders to maximize the provision of accommodation in NTB, especially Lombok Island, as a super-priority tourist area, in terms of facilities, prices, information access, and distribution of accommodation.

## Insights (based on query results using sql)
1. The type of accommodation on Lombok Island is dominated by hotels with a total of 363. The number of available accommodations needs to be adjusted in accordance with the number of tourists visiting Lombok Island (reaching 2 million tourists at the end of 2024).
2. The areas with the most accommodations are the Senggigi and Kuta regions, which are famous for their marine tourism and are widely visited by tourists. The distribution of accommodation availability also needs to be considered, for instance, by increasing the number of accommodations in priority tourist areas such as Mandalika, Kuta, Senggigi, Sembalun, Gili Tramena, etc.
3. NTB, especially Lombok Island, is not only a tourist destination but also widely used as a business meeting area. Therefore, accommodations with business facilities are also needed so that investors/businesspeople/important state guests can utilize Lombok Island as a destination, which indirectly can make Lombok Island more known. Based on the analysis, several accommodations in the central area of NTB (Mataram) have been identified to provide business facilities.
4. The above query displays accommodations in one of Lombok Island's famous tourist areas, namely the Senggigi area. Based on the output, it is known that some accommodations have high ratings (ranging from 8-10), indicating tourists' satisfaction with these accommodations. Additionally, these accommodations have affordable prices for all categories of tourists.
5. This data can measure whether the available accommodations can reach all categories of tourists in terms of price. Some areas still have relatively high average accommodation prices, which may be due to being elite areas, limited number of accommodations, resulting in high prices, etc.
6. This data can be a source for evaluating the performance/services provided by accommodations. The majority have good reviews, resulting in high ratings.
